p4c is a reference compiler for the P4 programming language. It supports both P4-14 and P4-16; you can find more information about P4 here and the specifications for both versions of the language here. One fact attesting to the level of quality and completeness of p4c's code is that its front-end code, mid-end code, and p4c-graphs back end are used as the basis for at least one commercially supported P4 compiler.
